Summary
This paper studies the problem of node clustering on temporal graphs. Temporal graphs have some unique properties that should be taken into account, such as dynamically changing graph topology and the restriction that earlier nodes cannot observe later nodes in chronological order. This paper achieves the integration of these properties into node clustering by combining a temporal module for time information mining and a clustering module for node clustering. While each of these components may be basic individually, their synergistic combination results in an effective strategy for the task. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed approach.

Strengths

This paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.
This paper is well-motivated, considering that deep clustering for temporal graphs is a relatively unexplored yet relevant problem. I hope that this paper can serve as a milestone for further development in this problem setting.
The effectiveness of the proposal has been thoroughly evaluated on experiments, showcasing superior performance compared to various existing approaches on real-world datasets.
Weaknesses

There are inconsistencies in the notations, and some careful (minor) revisions are required. In Eq. (2), "
" is used. According to Def. 2, 
, hence if we strictly follow this definition, "
" in Eq. (2) is a pair 
. However, 
 does not make sense, and I think this is not what the authors want to represent. The problem here is that the definition of 
 in Def. 2 and notations such as 
 and 
 are not consistent. Please correct them.
Justification For Why Not Higher Score:
While the proposed method is well-designed, as mentioned in the meta-review, the technical novelty of each component is not exceptionally high. Additionally, there is no theoretical analysis, and some presentation requires minor revision. Considering my opinion and the reviewers' scores, I believe "Accept (poster)" is appropriate for this paper.

Justification For Why Not Lower Score:
This paper is well-written and deserves to be published. During the author-reviewer discussion phase, several concerns were raised by reviewers, and the authors have successfully addressed most of them in their response. As a result, every reviewer now recommends the acceptance of the paper. Therefore, I recommend accepting the paper.
